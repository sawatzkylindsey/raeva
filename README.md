raeva
=====
raeva is a lightweight web-application that you can deploy to allow you and your friends and family to share media on.  this concept is akin to other web-apps such as facebook, flickr, picasa, etc.  however, raeva is built with the intention of:
 1) allowing multiple media types
 2) doing away with all extraneous 'cruft' (liking, ads, etc)
 3) self deployed, so that you:
  -control where the server lives
  -control the type of security protecting both the network data transfer and the physical data store
  -know you're never going to be farmed and sold for information or your content will be put to use for something more than you intend

..more to come!
